You may also allow collapsible items to be open at the same time.\n\nThe collapse JavaScript plugin serves to show and hide content. Buttons or anchors are triggers mapped to the specific elements you toggle. Collapsing an element will `animate the height` from its current value to `0`. Given how CSS handles animations, you cannot use padding on a `.collapse` element. Instead, use the class as an independent wrapping element.\n\nThese elements are useful in groups.
